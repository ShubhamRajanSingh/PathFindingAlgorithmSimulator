# PathFindingAlgorithmSimulator
  I created this project to help myself get a better understanding of Path Finding Algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's. This Project shows a visual representaion of A* and Dijkstra's.There are many path finding algorithm but the reson why i choose this two algorithm for this project is that this two methods are quite famous. Dijstra's algorithm help's a lot to get a basic understanding of how path finding algorithm works.
  
# Technologies 
  I have used Javafx for this project. Javafx is made to replace swing and is much more powerfull then swing.
# Description
  In this Project i have used JavaFx  to give a visual representation of A* and Dijkstra's Path finding Algorithm.I have used this two algorithms to get the shortest path between two specified points. I have also shown some statistics in the left panel to get some information like Number of nodes considered, time rewuited,etc.This Statistics can help the user to compare the two Algorithms.
