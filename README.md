# PathFindingAlgorithmSimulator
  I created this project to help myself get a better understanding of Path Finding Algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's. This Project shows a visual representaion of A* and Dijkstra's.There are many path finding algorithm but the reson why i choose this two algorithm for this project is that this two methods are quite famous. Dijstra's algorithm help's a lot to get a basic understanding of how path finding algorithm works.
  
# Technologies 
  I have used Javafx for this project. Javafx is made to replace swing and is much for powerfull then swing.
